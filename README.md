## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

* **React Native CLI** is a package that contains tools and helpers for React Native projects in form of a command line tool.  [Download React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

## Setting up Databases and Services

The project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and [Redis](https://redis.io).

I recommend use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to install and run the databases and services above.
